This paper introduces a new approach for novelty detection, which builds upon the foundational principles of the Isolation Forest, more specifically the Half-Space Tree algorithm. The enhanced algorithm is described theoretically, detailing modifications that improve its performance in identifying novel data points. Through comparative analysis, significant differences between the traditional Isolation Forest and this enhanced algorithm are highlighted, showcasing modifications that contribute to increased efficacy. Additionally, this paper provides empirical evidence demonstrating that the enhanced algorithm successfully detects novelty data points, an ability absent in the original Isolation Forest. These findings underscore the potential of the approach presented here to advance the field of anomaly detection by providing a more robust tool for identifying novel occurrences in data sets.

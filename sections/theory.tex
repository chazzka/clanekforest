\label{sec:theory}
Since this article is centered around the anomaly detection algorithm topics, several terms that will be seen across the rest of the article have to be introduced.
\begin{description}
    \item[(Data) point] Any observable data with \(n\) dimensions.
    \item[Regular point] Data point included in the given dataset. Its features are expected.
    \item[Anomaly] Data point that differs significantly from other observations.
    \item[Outlier] Anomaly included in the given dataset.
    \item[Novelty] Anomaly that is not present in the given dataset during
learning. Novelties are supplied later during evaluation.
    \item[Supervised algorithm] Algorithm, that is being trained on all available data labels.
    \item[Unsupervised algorithm] Algorithm, that does not get any labels for the training data.
    \item[Semi-supervised algorithm] Algorithm that is trained on data of only one class.
\end{description}
